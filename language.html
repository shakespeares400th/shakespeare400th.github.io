                                        English is heavily influenced by Shakespeare. Even after 4 centuries after his death, we use hundreds of his words and phrases in conversation, having written 38 plays, 154 sonnets and several poems.
<br><br>
Shakespeare's influence on our language comes prominently from his written works: his 154 sonnets, his famous being &#39Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day', are praised by many with them considered to be the most beautiful written sonnets in history; mainly by the fact that many say that he is able to capture the factor of love so cleanly and simply.
<br><br>
In addition, Shakespeare also wrote many plays, with themes such as poignant, comedic, tragic and romantic being routinely performed for 4 centuries. His plays are said to be ingenious in the way they portray love, power, discrimination, despair, hatred, greed and it was this portrayal which saw higher and lower classes both attracted to his plays at his time. And by many the plays are said to be such focused on human themes that they will endure forever ('Shakespeare is not of an age, but for all time' said Ben Jonson, an English playwright). His works also consequently made it possible for many other people to write plays: as playwriting was seen as a prestigious job. His plays, such as 'Midsummer Night's Dream' and 'Romeo and Juliet', are timeless with many old and current adaptations of them.
<br><br>
Moreover, Shakespeare&#39s contribution to the English has been significant. He gave us many words and phrases to express hope, despair, sorrow, rage, love, lust and his work has inspired modern entertainers - such as singer-songwriter Nick Lowe&#39s 1970s earworm, Cruel to be Kind, took its title from lines Hamlet addressed to his mother. &quotI must be cruel only to be kind." Shakespeare used over 15,000 words in his plays (to compare, there are 6,000 words in the Old Testament), with over 2,000 of them invented by himself by merging current and foreign vocabulary, he has given us many phrases to express human emotions such as 'gloomy' 'bedazzled', 'softhearted', 'in a pickle', 'a wild goose chase', 'advertising' 'gossip', 'fair play', 'to break the ice','a heart of gold'. All these from his plays, such as 'The Tempest', 'Romeo and Juliet', 'A Midsummer's Night Dream', 'Henry V'. We can see evidence for the quantity of language Shakespeare introduced by looking at The Oxford Dictionary of Quotation which devotes 66 pages to Shakespeare, this is compared to only 6 pages for Charles Dickens and 22 pages for the Bible. Also an encyclopaedia on concert music published in 1959 devotes more space to Shakespeare than to many composers. This shows us that broadness of Shakespeare influence and that he also had a large impact on not just the English language but also inspired many works of music (such as Berlioz's symphony). Also, Shakespeare contributed a large amount to the English language with his insults: they were said to be cleverly placed and written so any class could enjoy. This shows us the extent to which Shakespeare went to, to make his plays understandable by anyone. Shakespeare was known to create new words by combining previous one, such as 'un' and 'arch' to their beginnings, creating words such as 'uncomfortable'. This made its debut in Romeo and Juliet: "Capulet: 'Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now to murder, murder our solemnity?'  (Act 4, Scene 5)  
<br><br>
William Shakespeare is credited for being one of the first writers to use modern prose in his writing: that is, he wrote with such fluidity of rhythm in his writing and crafted sentences which would have different meaning, each meaning developing a character or the story. We can see evidence for this in these lines from 'Richard III':
<br><br>
Rivers: Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty<br />
Will soon recover his accustomed health.
Grey: In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.<br />
Therefore, for God's sake entertain good comfort
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
Queen Elizabeth. If [the King] were dead, what would betide on me? <br />
Grey: No other harm but loss of such a lord.<br />
Queen Elizabeth: The loss of such a lord includes all
harms.  (1.3.1-8)
<br><br>
The main meaning of these lines suggest concern about poor health of King. On the other hand, we can see developments in the characters in each line: for example, we can see 'Rivers' is shown to not care about the King's health and only the Queen's health, maybe expecting a promotion. Queen Elizabeth is also shown to worry more about The King after his death. We can see that Shakespeare's work was extremely different from other authors of his time
by comparing his work to those, for example, of Thomas Churchyard (active 1555-1575) or George Whetstone (active 1574-1587).
<br><br>
Furthermore, Shakespeare also changed the concepts of stories told. Bruno Bettelheim and Robert Bly tell us that psychology is best revealed through story-telling and this is what Shakespeare managed to achieve, with stories which reflect to us and give reasons and questions to who we are and what we belong to. These concepts were only first explored by Shakespeare and allowed the human race to widen its perspectives on all subjects, developing our understandings and encouraging us to ask questions.  
<br><br>
Shakespeare's play has been translated into every major language and there are over 100 Shakespeare festivals around the world.
<br><br>
His characters are also said to be a large factor in his success: with Shakespeare being able to create complex characters which can be relatable by the higher and lower class. E.g. the complexity of his characters can be seen with Hamlet, who was forced to seek murderous revenge.
<br><br>
In addition, Shakespeare was also a leading figure in the development of the English grammar. One way which Shakespeare helped develop grammar was with inflectional endings. These are suffixes which indicates the change to a word's meaning. E.g. adding 's' to 'bat' changes the meaning of the word (makes it plural). The English language before Shakespeare used lots of unnecessary inflection endings, however, Shakespeare writing made less use of these creating a more flexible language. This tells us the fact that Shakespeare was a revolutionary figure in changing the normal rules of the English language and shows the fact that Shakespeare's writing was indifferent to the common writing of his age. Also, Shakespeare used more verb forms of words instead of nouns: e.g. instead of 'he fooled me'. Also, he commonly turned verbs into adjectives. With these changes and more, Shakespeare helped to standardize the English language, which fully came into place in the 18th century when Samuel Johnson published his 'Dictionary of the English Language', and make it more accessible to more people. This helped, epically, during the rise of the British Empire.
<br><br>
Although less known, Shakespeare's influence on poetry was also significant. He used rhyme, similes and was one of the first to use an iambic pentameter, which is a style of poetry where there are 10 syllables in each line, alternating from hard to soft sounds, to create inspiring sonnets and poems. An iambic pentameter increases the rhythm of the writing and some of Shakespeare's most memorable lines have been written in iambic pentameter, E.g in Romeo and Juliet: "Two households both alike in dignity". We can see evidence for the inspiration his poems held by the fact that Shakespeare's poems inspired John Keats, a famous English Romantic Poet, by the fact that both used similar styles. Shakespeare included strong words and images in his poems, such as:
<br><br>
"Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart; Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea."
<br><br>
Shakespeare also created what is known as 'blank verse'. This is a non-rhyming iambic pentameter and helped to created more realistic speech and to make the rhythm of the story flow. This method is considered by many as the closest to English speech patterns and helped to create and develop a more relatable story for an audience. This also may suggest why Shakespeare's plays are liked by all types of people (as they written in a relatable way).
