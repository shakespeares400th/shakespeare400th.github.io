                                        As well as language, Shakespeare has also made a large impact on our culture and political lives and beliefs.
<br><br>
Shakespeare's play 'Julius Caesar' is said to inspire the murderer of one of the most popular President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. On November 25, 1864, the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, played Marc Antony in the play 'Julius Caesar' at New York Winter Garden Theatre. However, later on April 14 1865, Booth would assassinate Lincoln at Ford Theatre Washington, DC, taking inspiration from the Brutus, the assassin in 'Julius Caesar'. The play's assassination and the actual assassination share many similarities: such as both took place in a theatre and both assassins shout "Sic Semper Tyrannus" after the killings. John Wilkes Booth wrote in his diary: "After being hunted like a dog through swamps, woods, and last night being chased by gun-boats till I was forced to return wet cold and starving, with every man's hand against me, I am here in despair. And why? For doing what Brutus was honoured for." This shows us the power and genuineness that Shakespeare characters were written to (for someone to become inspired by the play) and the fact that the writing was perfectly crafted for the public to understand and express feelings for the play, even after 200 years of Shakespeare's death.
<br><br>
As well as this, Shakespeare plays are also said to invigorate the Nazis. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, the Nazi Party encouraged Shakespeare's plays in Germany, for example they created the book called 'Shakespeare - A Germanic Writer'. Shortly after, there were more performances of Shakespeare's plays in Germany than the rest of the world combined. Suggesting that the Nazis may have seen parallels with some of the characters in Shakespeare's plays.
<br><br>
Moreover, Shakespeare's work has also influenced and inspired many other writers, such as Charles Dickens and John Keats. However, most notably, Shakespeare had a large influence on Leo Tolstoy, considered by many one of the greatest authors of all time. Tolstoy wrote a book about his despise for Shakespeare called 'Tolstoy on Shakespeare', where he says that, even though, all his work derived from Shakespeare, he found Shakespeare's work to be "irresistible repulsion and tedium" These show us that not only did Shakespeare have direct causes, he had indirect causes by inspiring many of the world's greatest writers.
<br><br>
William Shakespeare taught many key skills and concepts to the public at the time. Most notably is the fact that everything develops and worsens with history. He expresses this in his 55th sonnet saying that objects like "marble," "the gilded monuments of princes" and "statues" will all corrode with history. He also expresses that fact that writing would be able to 'cheat time'. These suggest a potential reasoning for Shakespeare writings (the fact he wanted records of the past to stay intact) and also suggest how the public at the time was being education in these key concepts of life, which had the potential to inspire many people to the art of writing.
<br><br>
Furthermore, Shakespeare's plays have also affected the actors playing the characters in his plays. For example, Paul Robeson, an African-American actor played Othello in a record-breaking run of the play, which addresses themes such as racism, at the Shubert Theatre in the 1940s. This resulted in Robeson becoming the most famous African-American and allowed him great influence in promoting the image of a strong black character. Robeson's actions allowed him to start the Civil Rights Movement. "'Othello' has taken away from me all kinds of fears, all sense of limitation, and all racial prejudice," Paul Robeson reported. This suggests the popularity that Shakespeare's plays have, with the converge Othello received, and that Shakespeare wrote the characters with so much power and reflectiveness using key questions and themes that the plays and characters are able to gain popularity 300 years after his death, and people still express feelings for the characters in the modern time.
